Figure 1 is an interactive media.  This interactive media shows a time line with Ethernet standards from 1973 through 2006.  As you move the slider closer to 2006, you see the newer standards and their description.  At the same time, there is a graphic that represents bandwidth and it grows in size as the slider moves closer to 2006. Figure 2 shows the Ethernet II frame structure: 8 byte preamble, 6 byte destination address, 6 byte source address, 2 byte type field, 46 to 1500 byte data field, and 4 byte frame check sequence.

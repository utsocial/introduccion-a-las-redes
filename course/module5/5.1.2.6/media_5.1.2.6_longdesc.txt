This animation shows several computers connected to a switch.  Host 1 wants to send a packet to all other hosts (a broadcast).  The diagram shows the MAC address and IP address of host 1.  The graphic also shows the frame with source and destination MAC address and the encapsulated packet with source and destination IP address.  The destination MAC address is formed by all Fs (the broadcast MAC address).  When the animation plays, the frame travels from host 1 to all other hosts connected to the switch.

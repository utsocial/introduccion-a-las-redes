Figure 1 shows the seven layers of the OSI model with the lower two layers highlighted.  This figure demonstrates that Ethernet spans Layers 1 and 2.  802.3 covers Layer 1 and the MAC sublayer of Layer 2.  802.2 is the LLC sublayer and covers the upper half of Layer 2. Figure 2 shows a different representation of how the different implementations of Ethernet span the layers.  In this figure, we see that Ethernet, Fast Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet spans Layer 1 and the lower half of Layer 2.

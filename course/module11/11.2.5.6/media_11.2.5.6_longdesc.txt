Figure 1 shows the output of show file systems command on a router.  The usbflash0: file system is highlighted. Figure 2 shows the output of the "copy running-config usbflash0:" command two times.  Once when the destination file does not exist and once when it does.  If the destination file already exists the user is prompted to over write it. Figure 3 shows the output of the "dir usbflash0:/" command.  It also demonstrates the ability to view the "R1-config" file in flash using the "more usbflash0:/R1-Config" command.

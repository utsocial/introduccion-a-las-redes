Figure 1 shows four routers connected one after the other via WAN links. Router A and Router D each have a switch and two PCs connected. Router A is entering the “traceroute 10.1.0.2” command to trace the route to Host 2 connected to Router D. Host 1 is entering the “tracert 10.1.0.2” command to also trace the same route. Figure 2 shows the command output for Host 1’s command. The trace failed after Router A.

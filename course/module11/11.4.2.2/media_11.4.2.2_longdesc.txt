Figures 1, 2, and 3 have the topology with a switch connected to a router. The devices have duplex mismatch. The switch is operating in full-duplex mode and the router is operating in half-duplex mode. Figure 1 also shows output for the switch’s console messages which indicate there is a duplex mismatch. Figure 2 displays output for the ‘show interfaces fastethernet 0/5’ command on the switch verifying that the switch is operating in full duplex mode. Figure 3 displays output for the ‘show interfaces gigabitethernet0/0’ common on the router verify that the router is operating in half-duplex mode.

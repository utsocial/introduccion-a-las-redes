Figure 1 shows the logical AND operation where 1 and 1 equal 1 and all other possibilities equal zero. Figure 2 shows the dotted decimal and binary formats for the IP address 192.168.10.10. Figure 3 adds the dotted decimal and binary formats for the subnet mask 255.255.255.0 to Figure 2. Figure 4 shows the ANDing operation between the binary format of the IP address and the binary format of the subnet mask. Figure 5 shows the result of the ANDing operation is the network address, 192.168.10.0

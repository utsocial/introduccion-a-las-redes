The figure is an animation that shows a computer with an IPv4 address of 192.168.10.1 sending an ICMP echo request to a computer with an IPv4 address of 192.168.30.1.  The message travels from the sending computer through a switch to a router.  That router sends the request to another router, then to a switch, and finally to the destination computer.  The receiving computer sends back an ICMP echo reply.

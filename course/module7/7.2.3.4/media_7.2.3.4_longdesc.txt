Figure 1 shows a router with a switch connected. The router also has two other networks attached. The router is configured with the same FE80::1/64 IPv6 link-local address on all three interfaces. On one of the LANs, there are two computers, a server, and a printer attached to the switch.  A computer is using link-local source and destination addresses to send a job to the printer. The router would not forward this job to another LAN because link-local addresses is local to the link. Figure 2 show a router connected to another router. One of the routers has a PC connected. The two routers are using the link-local address to send routing updates. The PC is using the router's link-local address as its default gateway.

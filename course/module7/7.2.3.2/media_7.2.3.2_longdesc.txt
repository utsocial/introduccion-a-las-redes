The figure shows an example of /64 prefix notation in IPv6 addressing.  The IPv6 address 2001:0DB8:000A:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000 is divided into two parts. Four hextets or 64 bits on the left represents the network prefix and four hextets or 64 bits on the right represent the interface ID. The compressed IPv6 network address is written as 2001:DB8:A::/64

Figure shows a table with three columns and nine rows. The column headings are “Subnet Mask”, “32-bit Address”, “Prefix Length”. The purpose of the table is to show examples of dotted decimal subnet masks represented in binary and then the prefix notation. Prefix notation is a slash in front of the number of 1 bits in the subnet mask. For example, the subnet mask 255.255.255.0 can be represented with the prefix notation /24.

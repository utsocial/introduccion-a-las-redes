Figure 1 shows a topology with a router with two LANs and a connection to a WAN.  Each network is labeled with an IPv6 network address. A command window below the topology shows the configuration of the router interfaces with IPv6 addresses: 2001:db8:acad:1::1/64, 2001:db8:acad:2::1/64, and 2001:db8:acad:3::1/64. Figure 2 shows the Windows TCP/IPv6 Properties windows. Thg IPv6 address, subnet prefix length, and default gateway are configured. Figure 3 is a Syntax Checker in which the learner can practice configuring the router with IPv6 addressing.

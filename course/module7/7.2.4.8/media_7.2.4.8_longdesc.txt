Figure 1 shows a topology with one router connected to two LANs and a WAN. Below the topology the command window displays the output from the “show ipv6 interface brief” command. All three interfaces are “up” and “up”. Figure 2 shows the output from the “show ipv6 route” command with three connected networks listed along with their local network. In addition, the FE00::/8 network is listed. Figure 3 shows the command window for R1 with a successful ping to one of the computers on a LAN attached to R1. Figure 4 is a syntax checker activity in which the learner can practice enter commands to verify IPv6 address configuration.

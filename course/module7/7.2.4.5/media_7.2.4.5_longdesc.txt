Figure 1 shows an example of EUI-64. A computer uses the IPv6 global unicast of the router to construct its own global unicast  address. The computer uses the prefix from the router's address, which is 2001:DB8:ACAD:1 in the example. And then the computer uses EUI-64 to fill in the interface ID portion of the address. Figure 2 shows the E.U.I.-64 process for creating a 64 bit interface ID.  Step one begins with the example MAC address, FC:99:47:75:CE:E0.  The MAC address is split between the OUI and the device ID, and converted into binary.  In step two, the hexadecimal value FFFE is inserted between the OUI and the device ID. This makes converts the 48 bit MAC address into 64 bits.  In step three, the seventh high order bit is flipped from 0 to 1.  The modified MAC address is now the EUI-64 interface ID, FE:00:47:FF:FE:75:CE:E0. Figure 3 shows the Windows command line with the command "ipconfig" entered. The IPv6 global unicast address was generated using EUI-64. Figure 4 shows the Windows command line with the command "ipconfig" entered. The IPv6 global unicast address was created by generating a random 64-bit number for the interface ID.

Figure 1 shows a topology with router connected to two LANs and to a cloud. Each LAN has a PC and there is a PC in the cloud. All the devices are labeled with their IP addresses in binary format, which is a series of 32 binary digits separated by a period at every 8th bit. Figure 2 shows the same topology as Figure 1. But now the devices are labeled with their IPv4 addresses in dotted decimal notation. Figure 3 shows the IP address 192.168.10.10 in dotted decimal format and in binary digits format.

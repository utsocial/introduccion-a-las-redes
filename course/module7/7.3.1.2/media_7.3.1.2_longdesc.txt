Figure 1 shows a PC is booting and sends out an RS requesting an RA. The router is sending out RAs every 200 seconds. Clicking the two message types opens a textbox with more information. In Figure 2, one PC knows the IPv6 address of another PC but does not know the MAC address. It sends out a NS message, which is a solicited-node multicast. The PC replies with an NS unicast message. Figure 3 shows the DAD process with one PC using a solicited-node multicast to make sure other PCs are not currently using the IPv6 address that the PC wants to use.

Figure 1 shows that the types of addresses include the network address, host addresses, and broadcast address. The host address is divided into two address: the first host address and the last host address. Clicking each of the address types opens a textbox with more information. Figure 2 shows a dotted decimal example of each address type. The fourth octet is shown in binary. The main point of the figure is to show that the host portion of a network address is all zeros, the host portion of a host address will have at least one of the bits as a one, and the host portion of a broadcast address is all ones. Figure 3 through 7 show a topology with one router connected to a switch, and there are four computers connected to the switch. A solid circle background encompasses all the devices. All devices belong to the 10.1.1.0/24 network. In Figure 3, the network address is shown in binary below the topology. The host portion is all zeros. In Figure 4, the IP address 10.1.1.10 for one of the PCs is highlighted. The address is shown binary below the topology. The host portion shows that the 8 and 2 bits are turned on. In Figure 5, IP address 10.1.1.1 for the router is highlighted. This is the first host address. The address is shown in binary below the topology. The host portion shows that only the one bit is turned on. In Figure 6, IP address 10.1.1.254 for one of the PCs is highlighted. This is the last host address. The address is shown in binary below the topology. The host portion shows that all the bits except the one bit are turned on. In Figure 7, all the IP addresses in the topology are highlighted. The broadcast address 10.1.1.255 is shown in binary below the topology. The host portion shows that all the bits are turned on.

Figure 1 shows a single computer that has multiple web pages open along with an instant messaging window, an e-mail application, a streaming video application and a VoIP phone application running.  This represents that a computer typically has more than one process running any one time and it is the transport layer that tracks each individual conversation flowing between a source application and a destination application separately. Figure 2 shows a series of data blocks being transmitted to the computer.  The data blocks are of varying colors which correspond to different services. Figure 3 shows the computer sending the packages to the proper application, the web browser, the e-mail client, the streaming video application or the VoIP phone.  Each application has a specific data block color.  This represents the computer sorting the data based on application. Figure four shows the setup and termination of a data transfer session between a host and a server.

Figure is an animation that shows a computer sending a file to a server using the TFTP application, which utilizes the UDP at the transport layer.  The data is segmented into six segments and all packets leave the computer and are sent to a router and then directed to the TFTP server on a remote server farm network.  The server receives all the packets, but since it is using UDP no acknowledgment packet is sent from the server.

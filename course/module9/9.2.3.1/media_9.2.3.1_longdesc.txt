Figure shows two network segments connected through a network.  In one network segment there is a computer sending data, an I.P. phone, and a computer using a video application.  On the other segment there is a computer receiving the data sent by the sending computer, an IP phone, and a computer using a video application.  These are two examples of applications that utilize UDP due to its low overhead data transport method.  UDP provides this low overhead data transport because it has a small datagram header and no network management traffic.

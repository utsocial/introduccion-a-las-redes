Figures 1, 2 and 3 show three PCs attached to a hub. In Figure 1, PC1 says “The medium is available so I will send the Ethernet frame to PC3.” A frame is leaving PC1. In Figure 2, the hub forwards the frame to PC2 and PC3. PC2 says “I have a frame to send but I have to wait because I am receiving a frame.” In Figure 3, PC2 and PC3 receive the frame. PC2 says “This frame is not for me, so I will ignore it.” PC3 says, “This frame is for me, so I will copy in the entire frame.”

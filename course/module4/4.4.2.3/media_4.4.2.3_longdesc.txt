Figure 1 shows two routers connected with a point to point connection through a cloud.  The cloud is empty. Figure 2 shows the same two routers connected with a point to point connection through a cloud.  This cloud has several pieces of network equipment.  This demonstrates that sometimes a point to point is not a physical wire connecting two routers.

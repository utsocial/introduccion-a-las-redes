Figure 1 shows a topology with one router connected to two switches to create two LANs. The subnets 192.168.1.0/25 and 192.168.1.128/25 are assigned to the two LANs. Figure 2 shows the network address, first host address, last host address, and broadcast address for the 192.168.1.0/25 subnet. The last octet is in binary to show that a network address is all zeros in the host portion. The first host address is all zeros except the least significant bit in the host portion. The last host address is all ones except for the least significant bit in the host portion. And the broadcast address is all ones in the host portion. Similar to Figure 2, Figure 3 shows the network address, first host address, last host address, and broadcast address for the 192.168.1.128/25 subnet with the last octet shown in binary. Figure 4 shows the topology from Figure 1 with IP addresses assigned to the devices from the appropriate subnets. Figure 5 shows the TCP/IP Properties settings for Windows with static IP addressing assigned to one of the PCs from the second subnet.

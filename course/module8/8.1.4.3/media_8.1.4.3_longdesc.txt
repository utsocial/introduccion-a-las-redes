Figure 1 shows how a slash 22 has ten host bits which allows for 1022 valid hosts. Figure 2 shows a corporate network divided by department. The host requirements for each department are listed. Figure 3 shows the 172.16.0.0/22 address in binary. The network portion is highlighted in green and the host portion is highlighted in orange. Figure 4 shows the 16 subnets that are formed when creating borrowing four bits from 172.16.0.0/22.  You can see that by alternating bits 23, 24, 25, and 26 in a logical order, you can easily determine the network IDs for all sixteen subnets. Figure 5 shows how these subnets might be assigned to the departments in a corporate network.  Each subnet is the same size.

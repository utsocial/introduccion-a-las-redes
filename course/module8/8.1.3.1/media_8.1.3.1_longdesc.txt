Figure shows a table. The first column lists the fourteen prefix lengths from /27 to /30. The second column lists the fourteen subnet masks from 255.255.128.0 to 255.255.255.252. The third column shows the subnet mask in binary with the letter “n” above one bits and the letter “h” above zero bits. The effect is to show the borrowing of bits into the third and fourth octet from borrowing one bit in the first row (/17) to borrowing fourteen bits in the last row (/30). The fourth and fifth columns show the number of subnets and hosts respectively. For example, borrowing 5 bits gets you 32 subnets with 2046 hosts per subnet.

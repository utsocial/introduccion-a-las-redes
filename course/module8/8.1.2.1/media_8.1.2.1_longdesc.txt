Figure shows a table. Column one has the prefix lengths /8, /16 and /24. Column two has the subnet masks 255.0.0.0, 255.255.0.0, and 255.255.255.0. Column three shows the subnet mask in binary. Above each binary one is the letter “n” to represent that this is a network bit. About each binary zero is the letter “h” to represent that this is a host bit. Column three shows the number of hosts for each prefix length: 16,777,214, 65,534, and 254.

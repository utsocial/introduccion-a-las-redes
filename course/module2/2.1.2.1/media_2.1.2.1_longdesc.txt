Figure includes more text for console, SSH, and Telnet access methods. The advantage of using a console port is that the device is accessible even if no networking services have been configured, such as when performing an initial configuration of the networking device. When performing an initial configuration, a computer running terminal emulation software is connected to the console port of the device using a special cable. Configuration commands for setting up the switch or router can be entered on the connected computer. SSH is the recommended method for remote management because it provides a secure connection. SSH provides encrypted password authentication and transport of session data. This keeps the user ID, password, and the details of the management session private. Most versions of Cisco IOS include an SSH server and an SSH client that can be used to establish SSH sessions with other devices. Best practice dictates to use SSH instead of Telnet for remote management CLI connections. Cisco IOS includes a Telnet server and a Telnet client that can be used to establish Telnet sessions with other devices.

Figure 1 shows three types of media.  The first is copper cabling, the second is fiber optic cabling and the third is wireless signaling. Figure 2 lists the criteria for choosing media: What is the maximum distance that the media can successfully carry a signal? Into what type of environment will the media be installed? What is the amount of data and the speed at which it must be transmitted? What is the cost of the media and installation?

Figure shows the two networking models side by side, the seven layer OSI model and the four layer TCP/IP model. The main TCP/IP suite protocols are listed for each of the layers.  The application, presentation and session layers of the OSI. model line up with the Application layer of TCP/IP. model, and here are HTTP, DNS, DHCP, and FTP.  The Transport layers align together and carry TCP and UDP.  The OSI network layer aligns with the Internet layer of TCP/IP and carries both IP version 4 and version 6 along with ICMP for both versions 4 and 6.  The OSI data link and physical align with the TCP/IP network access layer and some of the protocols here are PPP, Frame Relay and Ethernet.

Figure shows the data encapsulation process as a message is passed down the protocol stack.  The example is an e-mail and it starts as data at layer seven.  The PDU is a segment when it acquires the transport layer header, then it becomes a packet when it receives the network header.  When the frame header and trailer are added the PDU becomes a frame.  As it moves to transmission across the medium it is in bits.
